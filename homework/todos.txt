+ Figure out the program components.

- Figure out the data structure to hold the client unique data.

+ Develop the logic for the base components and do more research on them.

		- a client-handler to initiate and maintain the server-client connection.
		- an IRC compatible command parser using the recent RFC.
- Create the server and client class based on limited knowledge about them and handle client registration.
